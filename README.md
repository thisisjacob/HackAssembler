An assembler for the Hack assembly language specified by the "The Elements of Computing Systems" textbook.

After building this project through Visual Studio, the program can be run by calling "HackAssembler.exe file.asm" where file is the name of the file to convert. 
The program then automatically converts the Hack code into machine code, which is saved to the file "file.hack".

The hack language is described here: https://www.nand2tetris.org/project04
